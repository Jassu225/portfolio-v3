# Jaswanth's Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my skills, professional experience, and featured projects in a clean, mobile-first design.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Carousel**: [Embla Carousel](https://www.embla-carousel.com/)
- **Linting/Formatting**: ESLint, Prettier

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a static export of the site in the `out` directory.

## Deployment

This site is optimized for deployment on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new). The easiest way to deploy is to link your GitHub repository to a new Vercel project. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js framework and deploy the site.
