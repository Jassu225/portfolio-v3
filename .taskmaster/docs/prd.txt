# Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a personal portfolio web application. The primary goal of this application is to showcase the user's skills, professional background, and featured projects to potential employers or clients. The application will be designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring full responsiveness across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

# Core Features
The initial version (MVP) of the portfolio will consist of the following sections, presented as a single-page scrolling experience:
- **Navigation Bar**: A responsive header that is sticky and contains links to different sections of the page.
- **Hero Section**: A prominent introductory section featuring the user's name ("Jaswanth Sai Sattenapalli" from the design), title ("Full-stack Developer"), and location ("San Francisco, CA"). It will include a profile picture.
- **About Section**: A brief biography to give visitors a personal glimpse into the user's background and passion.
- **Skills Section**: A section to display key skills as tags (e.g., "UI/UX Design", "User Research", "Prototyping").
- **Background Section**: A timeline-style section detailing professional experience and roles held at various companies (e.g., "Acme Co.", "Beta Inc.").
- **Featured Projects Section**: A gallery to showcase 2-4 featured projects, each with an image, a title, and a short description.
- **Footer**: A simple footer, which can be expanded later.

# User Experience
The user experience will be clean, modern, and intuitive, following the design provided in the Figma file.
- **User Journey**: Visitors will land on the Hero section and can scroll down to navigate through the About, Skills, Background, and Projects sections in a linear fashion. The navigation bar will provide shortcuts to each section.
- **Mobile-First Design**: The layout will be optimized for mobile screens first, with a single-column structure. It will then adapt for larger screens (tablet and desktop), potentially using multi-column layouts for sections like Skills and Projects to make better use of the space.
- **UI/UX Considerations**: The design is based on a dark theme with white and light-gray text. Interactive elements will have clear feedback (e.g., hover states for links and buttons).

# Technical Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js (with App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and responsiveness.
- **Component Structure**: The application will be built with reusable React components. Key components will include:
  - `Layout.tsx`: Main wrapper including `Navbar` and `Footer`.
  - `Navbar.tsx`: Responsive navigation component.
  - `Hero.tsx`: The top-of-the-fold hero section.
  - `About.tsx`: The about me section.
  - `Skills.tsx`: The skills section, likely mapping over an array of skills.
  - `SkillTag.tsx`: Component for individual skill tags.
  - `Background.tsx`: The background/experience section.
  - `ExperienceItem.tsx`: Component for each entry in the background section.
  - `Projects.tsx`: The featured projects section.
  - `ProjectCard.tsx`: Component for each project in the gallery.
  - `Footer.tsx`: The footer component.
- **Data Management**: For the MVP, all content (personal info, skills, experience, project details) will be hardcoded in TypeScript or JSON files within the project (e.g., in a `data` or `lib` folder). No external CMS or database will be used initially.
- **Deployment**: The application will be ready for deployment on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.

# Development Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**:
  1.  Set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
  2.  Implement the main `Layout`, including the responsive `Navbar` and a basic `Footer`.
  3.  Develop the `Hero` section component and populate it with content.
  4.  Develop the `About`, `Skills`, `Background`, and `Projects` section components.
  5.  Create mock data files for skills, experience, and projects.
  6.  Implement mobile-first responsiveness for all sections.
  7.  Test and refine the layout on various screen sizes.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  -   A functional contact form.
  -   Integration with a headless CMS (e.g., Sanity, Contentful) to manage content dynamically.
  -   A dedicated blog section.
  -   Subtle animations and page transitions to enhance user experience.
  -   A light/dark mode toggle.

# Logical Dependency Chain
Development should proceed in the following order to ensure a logical build process from foundation to features:
1.  **Project Setup**: Initialize the Next.js application.
2.  **Core Layout**: Build the main `Layout`, `Navbar`, and `Footer` to establish the page structure.
3.  **Static Content Sections**: Build the `Hero` and `About` sections, which are relatively static.
4.  **Data-Driven Sections**:
    -   Create data structures (files) for skills, experience, and projects.
    -   Build the `Skills` section and `SkillTag` component.
    -   Build the `Background` section and `ExperienceItem` component.
    -   Build the `Projects` section and `ProjectCard` component.
5.  **Assembly & Styling**: Integrate all sections into the main page, refine the overall styling, and ensure smooth scrolling and navigation.
6.  **Final Responsiveness Testing**: Thoroughly test and fix any styling issues across all target device breakpoints.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: The timeline for implementing all MVP features might be tight.
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize the core sections first (Hero, About, Projects). Skills and Background can be simplified if needed to meet deadlines.
- **Risk**: Achieving a pixel-perfect match with the Figma design can be time-consuming.
  - **Mitigation**: For the MVP, focus on matching the layout, color scheme, and typography. Minor deviations in spacing or sizing are acceptable. The goal is a professional and functional site, not a pixel-perfect replica.
- **Risk**: Content gathering (e.g., project descriptions, images) can delay development.
  - **Mitigation**: Use placeholder text and images initially to unblock UI development. The content can be replaced later without significant code changes.
