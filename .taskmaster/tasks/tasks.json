Adjust spacing and image size for a side-by-side presentation. - **About.tsx**: Increase the `max-w` of the text container on large screens to improve line length and readability. - **Background.tsx**: Refine the timeline's spacing and alignment for wider viewports to ensure it doesn't look sparse. - **Projects.tsx**: Update the grid from `md:grid-cols-2` to `lg:grid-cols-3` to better utilize horizontal space. - **Skills.tsx**: Ensure the `flex-wrap` container has appropriate horizontal constraints and gaps on desktop. - **Contact.tsx**: Adjust form fields to be side-by-side or in a grid on desktop, instead of stacked vertically.",
